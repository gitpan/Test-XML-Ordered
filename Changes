    that have them.

        - Thanks to NGLENN for the report and for some reproducing code.

0.0.5   2013-02-20
    - Display the offending mismatched text in a text node mismatch.
    - Normalise all space-areas to a single - not just the first one.

    <img></img>.

0.0.4   2013-02-20
    - Fix a bug where we compared ->name() instead of ->localname().

        the default namespace are the same.

    - Add t/00basic.t to get some diagnosis of the libxml2 versions.

    test issues.

    - Sped up the tests in t/xml_compare1.t by not loading external
    DTDs from w3.org.
